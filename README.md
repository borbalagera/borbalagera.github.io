# Hello, welcome
These are small projects I've created:

[An interactive shoppinglist, you can add and remove items.](https://borbalagera.github.io/shoppinglist/shoppinlist/shoppinglist.html) <br> [A slight variation of the shopping list, you can add items (names, IDs) and then draw a winner](https://borbalagera.github.io/winnerPicker/winner.html) <br> [A quite impossible 'click the button' game with a click counter.](https://borbalagera.github.io/hoverGame/hoverGame.html) <br> [A currency converter using API.](https://borbalagera.github.io/currencyconv/USDconverter)
